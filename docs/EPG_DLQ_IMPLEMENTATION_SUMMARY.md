# EPG DLQ Management & UI Improvements Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) management for EPG conflicts and improves the user interface by converting the EPG Viewer to a modal and enhancing the overall EPG management experience.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. DLQ Management System

#### Database Enhancements
- **Enhanced Channel Mapping**: Added smart channel mapping that automatically handles HD/SD variants
  - `apply_enhanced_channel_mapping()` method that detects patterns like "Channel HD" vs "Channel"
  - Automatically remaps conflicting channels to unique identifiers (e.g., `Channel.tv` ‚Üí `Channel_HD.tv`)
  - Applied during EPG ingestion to reduce conflicts before they reach the DLQ

- **DLQ Resolution Methods**:
  - `resolve_epg_dlq_entry()` - Mark DLQ entries as resolved with resolution notes
  - `get_epg_dlq_statistics()` - Generate comprehensive statistics about conflicts
  - `get_dlq_entries_for_remapping()` - Get unresolved entries for processing

#### API Endpoints
- **GET /api/epg/dlq** - Fetch DLQ entries with statistics
  - Returns both conflict entries and statistical analysis
  - Supports filtering by source_id and resolution status
  - Includes pattern analysis for common conflict types

- **POST /api/epg/dlq/resolve** - Resolve DLQ conflicts
  - Supports "remap" action to assign new channel IDs
  - Supports "ignore" action to mark conflicts as resolved
  - Batch processing for multiple resolutions

### 2. UI/UX Improvements

#### EPG Sources Page Enhancements
- **New Button Layout**:
  - Added "üì∫ View EPG" button next to "Add EPG Source"
  - Replaced "Refresh All EPG" with "‚ö†Ô∏è View Conflicts (DLQ)" in quick actions
  - Maintained individual refresh actions per source

#### DLQ Management Modal
- **Comprehensive Conflict View**:
  - Statistics dashboard showing total conflicts and common patterns
  - Searchable/filterable conflict list
  - Channel information with conflict type indicators
  - Individual resolution actions (Suggest Mapping, Ignore)

- **Pattern Analysis**:
  - Automatically detects HD/SD variants and other common patterns
  - Shows conflict frequency and examples
  - Helps users understand the nature of conflicts

#### EPG Viewer Modal
- **Converted from Standalone Page to Modal**:
  - Removed `/epg-viewer` route and navigation entry
  - Created modal version with embedded EPG viewer functionality
  - Maintains all original features (timeline, channel filtering, date selection)
  - Responsive design optimized for modal context

### 3. Enhanced Channel Mapping Logic

#### Smart Pattern Detection
- **HD/SD Variant Handling**:
  ```
  "HU: Eurosport 2 HD" ‚Üí Eurosport2_HD.hu
  "HU: Eurosport 2"    ‚Üí Eurosport2.hu
  ```
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Multiple channels with same base pattern get numbered suffixes
- **Conflict Prevention**: Applied during ingestion to prevent duplicates reaching DLQ

#### Integration Points
- **EPG Ingestor**: Enhanced mapping applied after parsing, before saving channels
- **DLQ Resolution**: Allows manual remapping of conflicting channels
- **Statistics**: Tracks pattern effectiveness and remaining conflicts

### 4. Navigation & Workflow Updates

#### Streamlined Navigation
- **Removed EPG Viewer from Navigation**: Converted to modal access only
- **Updated Workflow**: EPG Sources ‚Üí Data Mapping ‚Üí Proxies (simplified)
- **Quick Access**: EPG Viewer accessible via dedicated buttons

#### Improved User Experience
- **Modal-Based Interactions**: Reduces page navigation overhead
- **Contextual Actions**: DLQ management directly accessible from EPG Sources
- **Visual Indicators**: Conflict types clearly marked with color-coded badges

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- **Existing DLQ Table**: Leveraged existing `epg_dlq` table structure
- **Resolution Tracking**: Uses `resolved` flag and `resolution_notes` for audit trail
- **Statistics Queries**: Optimized queries for pattern analysis and conflict counting

### Frontend Architecture
- **Modal System**: Reusable modal components for both DLQ and EPG Viewer
- **State Management**: JavaScript class-based approach for modal state
- **API Integration**: RESTful API calls for DLQ management and EPG data

### Backend Processing
- **Enhanced Ingestion**: Modified EPG ingestor to apply smart mapping
- **Conflict Resolution**: API endpoints handle both automatic and manual resolution
- **Pattern Analysis**: Server-side analysis of conflict patterns for insights

## Usage Workflow

### For Users Managing EPG Conflicts:
1. **Access DLQ Management**: Click "‚ö†Ô∏è View Conflicts (DLQ)" from EPG Sources page
2. **Review Conflicts**: View statistics and individual conflict entries
3. **Resolve Conflicts**: Use "Suggest Mapping" for automatic suggestions or "Ignore" to dismiss
4. **Track Resolution**: Monitor resolution notes and statistics

### For EPG Viewing:
1. **Quick Access**: Click "üì∫ View EPG" button from EPG Sources page
2. **Modal Experience**: Full EPG timeline view in modal without navigation
3. **Filtering**: Search channels, select date ranges, adjust time windows
4. **Close and Continue**: Return to EPG Sources without losing context

## Benefits Achieved

### Reduced Data Loss
- **Smart Mapping**: Automatically resolves HD/SD conflicts before they become problems
- **Manual Resolution**: Provides tools to recover previously conflicted channels
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies and addresses systematic conflict sources

### Improved User Experience
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Less page navigation, more contextual actions
- **Better Visibility**: DLQ conflicts no longer hidden, easy to access and manage
- **Efficient Resolution**: Bulk operations and smart suggestions reduce manual work

### Enhanced System Reliability
- **Proactive Conflict Prevention**: Enhanced mapping reduces DLQ growth
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Full audit trail of conflict resolution
- **Statistical Insights**: Data-driven understanding of conflict patterns
