# Solution Summary: Base URL Configuration & Data Mapping Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive solution implemented to address three critical issues in the M3U Proxy data mapping system:

1. **Logo URLs were relative paths** instead of full URLs accessible by clients
2. **Data mapping rules weren't working** due to case sensitivity issues
3. **No immediate way to apply rules** to existing channels without waiting for source refresh

## Problem Analysis

### Issue 1: Relative Logo URLs
**Problem:** Data mapping rules generated relative URLs like `/api/logos/uuid` instead of full URLs.
**Impact:** M3U players and external clients couldn't access logos since they need absolute URLs.

### Issue 2: Case Sensitivity in Rule Matching
**Problem:** Rule condition `tvg_id equals "skysportsf1.uk"` didn't match channels with `tvg_id = "SkySportsF1.uk"`.
**Impact:** Data mapping rules never triggered, making the system appear broken.

### Issue 3: No Immediate Rule Application
**Problem:** Rules only applied during source ingestion (scheduled or manual refresh).
**Impact:** Poor user experience - no way to test rules or apply them immediately to existing data.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Base URL Configuration System

#### New Configuration Option
```toml
[web]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080
base_url = "http://localhost:8080"  # NEW: Base URL for full URL generation
```

#### URL Utility Functions
Created `src/utils.rs` functions:
- `sanitize_base_url(base_url: &str) -> String`
- `generate_logo_url(base_url: &str, logo_id: Uuid) -> String`


#### URL Sanitization Features
- Removes trailing slashes: `http://localhost:8080/` ‚Üí `http://localhost:8080`
- Adds missing scheme: `localhost:8080` ‚Üí `http://localhost:8080`
- Handles multiple slashes: `http://localhost:8080//` ‚Üí `http://localhost:8080`

### 2. Case-Insensitive Rule Matching

#### Updated Condition Evaluation
Modified `src/data_mapping/engine.rs` to use case-insensitive string comparisons:

```rust
// Before (case-sensitive)
FilterOperator::Equals => Ok(field_value == condition.value),

// After (case-insensitive)
FilterOperator::Equals => Ok(field_value.to_lowercase() == condition.value.to_lowercase()),
```

#### Affected Operators
- `Equals` / `NotEquals`
- `Contains` / `NotContains`
- `StartsWith` / `EndsWith`

**Note:** Regex operators were already case-insensitive via `RegexBuilder::case_insensitive(true)`.

### 3. Immediate Rule Application Features

#### New API Endpoints

##### Preview Rules (`GET /api/data-mapping/preview`)
Shows detailed preview of what rules will do before applying:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule_name": "F1>Sports",
      "affected_channels_count": 10,
      "affected_channels": [
        {
          "channel_name": "VIP: SKY SPORTS F1 ·¥¥·¥∞",
          "actions_preview": [
            {
              "action_type": "set_logo",
              "target_field": "tvg_logo",
              "current_value": "http://icon-tmdb.me/...",
              "new_value": "http://localhost:8080/api/logos/c63d556e-7b3c-4a85-accd-214c32663482",
              "will_change": true
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Remap Existing Channels (`POST /api/data-mapping/remap`)
Applies all active rules to existing channels immediately:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Channel remapping completed",
  "sources_processed": 1,
  "total_channels_processed": 245,
  "total_channels_affected": 15
}
```

#### New UI Features
Added buttons to data mapping interface:
- **üëÅÔ∏è Preview Rules** - Generate detailed preview
- **üîÑ Remap Existing Channels** - Apply rules immediately

### Database Impact

#### Before Fix
```sql
SELECT tvg_id, tvg_logo, group_title FROM channels WHERE tvg_id = 'SkySportsF1.uk';
-- tvg_id: SkySportsF1.uk
-- tvg_logo: http://icon-tmdb.me/stalker_portal/misc/logos/320/12415.jpg?89982
-- group_title: (empty)
```

#### After Fix
```sql
SELECT tvg_id, tvg_logo, group_title FROM channels WHERE tvg_id = 'SkySportsF1.uk';
-- tvg_id: SkySportsF1.uk
-- tvg_logo: http://localhost:8080/api/logos/c63d556e-7b3c-4a85-accd-214c32663482
-- group_title: Sports
```

## Testing and Verification

### Unit Tests
Created comprehensive tests in `src/utils.rs`:
- URL sanitization with various input formats
- Logo URL generation with different base URLs
- Edge cases like missing schemes and trailing slashes

### Integration Points
- Scheduler service passes base URL during ingestion
- API endpoints use base URL for logo asset responses
- Data mapping preview shows full URLs
- Rule application generates proper absolute URLs

### Configuration Validation
- Default configuration uses `http://localhost:8080`
- Example configuration includes production scenarios
- Environment supports various deployment methods (Docker, K8s, reverse proxy)

## Deployment Considerations

### Configuration Examples

#### Development
```toml
base_url = "http://localhost:8080"
```

#### Production with Domain
```toml
base_url = "https://m3u-proxy.example.com"
```

#### Docker Deployment
```toml
base_url = "http://docker-host:8080"
```

#### Kubernetes with Ingress
```toml
base_url = "https://m3u-proxy.k8s.example.com"
```

### Migration Path
1. **Existing deployments** continue working with relative URLs
2. **New deployments** get full URLs by default
3. **Existing data** can be updated using "Remap Existing Channels" feature
4. **No breaking changes** to existing API contracts

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Overhead
- **URL generation:** O(1) string concatenation
- **URL sanitization:** O(n) where n is base URL length (typically < 100 chars)
- **Memory usage:** Base URL stored once in configuration
- **Network impact:** None (same URL length, different content)

### Improved User Experience
- **Immediate feedback** via rule preview
- **Instant rule application** without waiting for ingestion
- **Visual confirmation** of rule effects before applying
- **Detailed change tracking** showing before/after values

## Security Considerations

### URL Generation
- **Input validation:** Base URL is sanitized to prevent malformed URLs
- **Scheme enforcement:** HTTP scheme added for URLs without protocol
- **No injection risks:** UUID-based logo IDs prevent path traversal

### Access Control
- **Same origin policy:** Logo URLs use same base as application
- **HTTPS support:** Full HTTPS URL generation for secure deployments
- **Internal access:** Configuration supports internal vs external URLs

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Selective remapping** - Apply rules to specific sources only
2. **Dry run mode** - Preview with actual database write simulation
3. **Rule conflict detection** - Identify overlapping rules
4. **Performance optimization** - Batch processing for large datasets
5. **Rule analytics** - Track rule effectiveness over time

### Monitoring Capabilities
- **Server logs** include detailed rule application tracking
- **API responses** provide processing statistics
- **UI feedback** shows real-time progress and results
- **Error handling** gracefully manages failures without data loss

## Conclusion

This comprehensive solution addresses all three critical issues:

‚úÖ **Logo URLs are now full URLs** that work with any M3U player or client
‚úÖ **Case sensitivity fixed** - rules now match channels regardless of case
‚úÖ **Immediate rule application** - no waiting for source refresh required
‚úÖ **Rule preview** - see exactly what will change before applying
‚úÖ **Flexible deployment** - works with any hostname/port configuration

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while significantly improving user experience and system reliability. The base URL configuration ensures that M3U Proxy works correctly in any deployment scenario, from local development to production Kubernetes clusters.
