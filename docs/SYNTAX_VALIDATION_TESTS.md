# Extended Syntax Validation Test Cases

## Overview

This document contains comprehensive test cases to validate the extended filter syntax design against complex real-world use cases. These tests ensure the grammar is robust, expressive, and handles edge cases properly.

## Test Categories

1. **Basic Action Tests** - Simple condition + action patterns
2. **Complex Condition Tests** - Multi-condition expressions with actions  
3. **Multiple Action Tests** - Single condition with multiple actions
4. **Assignment Operator Tests** - All four operators in various scenarios
5. **Edge Case Tests** - Boundary conditions and error scenarios
6. **Real-World Scenario Tests** - Practical use cases from actual deployments
7. **Performance Tests** - Complex expressions that might impact performance

- Variable references - planned for Phase 4

### Key Validation Outcomes

1. **Grammar Completeness**: All intended syntax patterns are expressible
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and reporting
3. **Performance**: Acceptable parsing and execution performance
4. **Backward Compatibility**: 100% compatible with existing filter syntax
5. **Real-World Applicability**: Covers actual use cases from deployment scenarios

## Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Priority 1**: Implement basic action syntax (Tests 1.x, 2.x, 3.x)
2. **Priority 2**: Implement all assignment operators (Tests 4.x)
3. **Priority 3**: Robust error handling (Tests 5.x)
4. **Priority 4**: Performance optimization (Tests 7.x)
5. **Future**: Advanced features like regex captures and variables

The extended syntax design successfully validates against complex real-world use cases while maintaining simplicity and backward compatibility. The grammar is ready for Phase 3 implementation.
