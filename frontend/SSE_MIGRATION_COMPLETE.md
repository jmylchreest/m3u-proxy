# SSE Client Migration Complete

## Summary
Successfully migrated all components from the old SSE client to the unified ProgressProvider system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Components Migrated
- âœ… `components/proxies.tsx` - Migrated to use `useProgressContext`
- âœ… `components/stream-sources.tsx` - Migrated to use `useProgressContext`  
- âœ… `components/epg-sources.tsx` - Migrated to use `useProgressContext`

### 2. Migration Details

#### Before (Old SSE Client)
```typescript
import { sseClient } from "@/lib/sse-client"

// In component
sseClient.subscribe('proxy_regeneration', handleEvent)
// Cleanup
sseClient.unsubscribe('proxy_regeneration', handleEvent)
```

#### After (ProgressProvider)
```typescript
import { useProgressContext } from "@/providers/ProgressProvider"

// In component
const progressContext = useProgressContext()
const unsubscribe = progressContext.subscribeToType('proxy_regeneration', handleEvent)
// Cleanup
unsubscribe()
```

### 3. Files Deleted
- âœ… `/lib/sse-client.ts` - Old SSE client no longer needed

## Benefits of Migration

### 1. Single SSE Connection
- Before: Multiple SSE connections (one per component type)
- After: Single SSE connection managed by ProgressProvider

### 2. Better Error Handling
- Exponential backoff for reconnection
- Maximum retry limits
- Backend connectivity awareness

### 3. Resource Management
- Automatic cleanup of old events
- Memory usage optimization
- Connection pooling prevention

### 4. Safety Features
- No SSE attempts when backend unavailable
- Proper connection teardown
- Browser hang prevention

## Architecture Now

```
Single SSE Connection (sse-singleton.ts)
         â†“
    ProgressProvider
         â†“
    All Components
    â”œâ”€â”€ NotificationBell
    â”œâ”€â”€ Proxies Page
    â”œâ”€â”€ Stream Sources Page
    â”œâ”€â”€ EPG Sources Page
    â””â”€â”€ Events Page
```

## Remaining SSE Systems

### 1. Progress Events (Unified) âœ…
- Single connection via `sse-singleton.ts`
- Managed by ProgressProvider
- Used by all components

### 2. Logs (Separate)
- Still uses `logs-client.ts`
- Only active on logs page
- Has safety measures in place

## Next Steps (Future)

### Option 1: Keep Logs Separate
- Pros: Clear separation of concerns
- Cons: Two SSE connections when on logs page

### Option 2: Merge Logs into Main SSE
- Implement event type discrimination
- Route log events to logs page only
- Single connection for everything

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify proxies page receives proxy events
- [ ] Verify stream sources page receives stream events
- [ ] Verify EPG sources page receives EPG events
- [ ] Check browser Network tab - only one SSE connection
- [ ] Stop backend - verify graceful handling
- [ ] Restart backend - verify reconnection works
- [ ] Check memory usage over time

## Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

All components now use the unified ProgressProvider system with proper safety measures and resource management.
